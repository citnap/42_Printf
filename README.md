# Printf Replicated Function

## About
This project is a custom implementation of the `printf` function using only the `unistd.h` library. It's built to demonstrate low-level output handling without relying on standard I/O libraries like `stdio.h`.

## Instructions

To compile all source files, simply run:

```bash
make
